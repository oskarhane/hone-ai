# Project Overview

PRIMARY LANGUAGES: [TypeScript]
USAGE CONTEXT: TypeScript is the sole programming language used. It powers the entire CLI application - an AI coding agent orchestrator that generates PRDs, manages tasks, and spawns AI agents (Claude/OpenCode). Built with Bun runtime, uses commander.js for CLI, js-yaml for YAML parsing, and the Vercel AI SDK. All source files in src/ are .ts including tests (*.test.ts).
