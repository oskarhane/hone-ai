TASK-001: Analyze current model validation implementation
Date: 2026-02-16T11:25:00.000Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Analyzed the existing model validation implementation in src/config.ts. The current system uses a Claude-only regex pattern that validates model names at multiple checkpoints for both agent-specific and phase-specific configurations.

Files Changed:
- .plans/tasks-fix-openai-model-provider-resolution-bug.yml (modified - marked task-001 as completed)

Key Decisions:
- Current regex pattern is /^claude-(sonnet|opus)-\d+-\d{8}$/ at src/config.ts:221
- Validation occurs at 3 checkpoints: agent-specific models (lines 224, 228) and phase-specific models (line 244)
- Impact scope includes all 7 phases: prd, prdToTasks, implement, review, finalize, agentsMd, extendPrd
- resolveModelForPhase() function follows priority: phase-specific > agent-specific > default model

Next Task: task-002 - Design multi-provider model validation regex

================================================================================
TASK-002: Design multi-provider model validation regex
Date: 2026-02-16T12:00:00.000Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Designed a comprehensive multi-provider model validation regex pattern that supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Google models while maintaining backward compatibility with legacy Claude model formats.

Files Changed:
- .plans/model-validation-regex-design.md (created - comprehensive documentation)
- .plans/tasks-fix-openai-model-provider-resolution-bug.yml (to be updated - mark task-002 as completed)

Key Decisions:
- New regex: /^(?:(?:openai|anthropic|google)\/[\w.-]+|claude-(?:sonnet|opus)-\d+-\d{8})$/
- Pattern supports provider-prefixed models: openai/, anthropic/, google/
- Model names allow: letters, numbers, dots, hyphens, underscores ([\w.-]+)
- Maintains backward compatibility with legacy Claude format: claude-(sonnet|opus)-\d+-\d{8}
- Provider list (openai|anthropic|google) can be extended for future providers

Design Rationale:
- Provider prefix pattern flexible enough for current and future AI providers
- Character class [\w.-]+ covers all common model naming conventions seen in wild
- Legacy Claude pattern preserved exactly to ensure zero breaking changes
- Full string anchors (^...$) prevent partial matches and maintain validation strength

Validation Examples:
Valid:
- openai/gpt-4o, openai/gpt-5.3-codex (OpenAI models)
- anthropic/claude-sonnet-4 (Anthropic provider prefix)
- claude-sonnet-4-20250514 (Legacy format)
- google/gemini-pro, google/gemini-1.5-flash (Google models)

Invalid:
- malformed-model-123 (wrong format, no provider)
- openai/ (missing model name)
- /gpt-4o (missing provider)
- openai/gpt 4o (spaces not allowed)

Next Task: task-003 - Update validateConfig function with new regex
================================================================================
TASK-003: Update validateConfig function with new regex
Date: 2026-02-16T13:30:00.000Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Updated validateConfig() function in src/config.ts with multi-provider model validation regex. Applied review feedback to improve error message accuracy regarding legacy Claude model format.

Files Changed:
- src/config.ts (modified - updated modelRegex at line 222 and error messages at lines 227, 233, 251)
- .plans/tasks-fix-openai-model-provider-resolution-bug.yml (modified - marked task-003 as completed)

Key Decisions:
- Replaced modelRegex with: /^(?:(?:openai|anthropic|google)\/[\w.-]+|claude-(?:sonnet|opus)-\d+-\d{8})$/
- Updated error messages to use "claude-(sonnet|opus)-N-YYYYMMDD" for better accuracy vs "claude-sonnet-4-YYYYMMDD"
- No changes to validation logic flow or function signature
- Applied low-priority review feedback for error message consistency

Review Feedback Applied:
- Changed error message from "claude-sonnet-4-YYYYMMDD" to "claude-(sonnet|opus)-N-YYYYMMDD" to accurately reflect regex pattern that accepts any digit for version number

Test Results:
- All 355 tests pass
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- Backward compatibility maintained

Next Task: task-004 - Add comprehensive unit tests for OpenAI model validation
================================================================================

TASK-004: Add comprehensive unit tests for OpenAI model validation (FINALIZED)
Date: 2026-02-16T14:45:00.000Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Applied review feedback by adding test for unknown provider rejection and fixing progress file documentation accuracy.

Files Changed:

Key Decisions:
- Added medium-priority test for unknown provider rejection (mistral/mixtral-8x7b)
- Fixed documentation inaccuracy (23 vs 18 tests) identified in review
- All 374 tests pass (373 → 374 with new unknown provider test)

Review Feedback Applied:

================================================================================
TASK-005: Test agent-specific OpenAI model configurations
Date: 2026-02-16T15:30:00.000Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Added 7 comprehensive integration tests to verify that OpenAI models work correctly with agent-specific configurations and resolveModelForPhase() function. Tests verify OpenAI models pass through unchanged and mixed OpenAI/Claude configurations work.

Files Changed:
- src/config.test.ts (modified - added 7 tests for OpenAI model resolution with agents)
- .plans/tasks-fix-openai-model-provider-resolution-bug.yml (modified - marked task-005 as completed)

7. OpenAI fallback to agent model when no phase-specific model

Key Decisions:
- Tests focus on resolveModelForPhase() integration, not just validation
- Verify OpenAI models pass through unchanged (acceptance criteria #4)
- Mixed configuration tests ensure both agents work independently
- Tests verify defaultAgent behavior with OpenAI models
- All phase fallback logic works correctly with OpenAI models

Test Results:

Acceptance Criteria Met:
✓ Config with opencode: openai/gpt-4o passes validation
✓ Config with claude: openai/gpt-4 passes validation
✓ Mixed configurations (opencode: openai/gpt-4o, claude: claude-sonnet-4) work
✓ resolveModelForPhase() returns OpenAI models unchanged

================================================================================

Summary:
Added 7 comprehensive tests to verify phase-specific OpenAI model overrides work correctly with resolveModelForPhase(). Tests confirm all 7 phases accept OpenAI models, phase-specific models override agent models, and mixed configurations work as expected.

Files Changed:
