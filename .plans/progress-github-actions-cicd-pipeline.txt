Summary:
Created GitHub Actions directory structure by initializing .github/workflows/ directory and ensuring Git tracking with .gitkeep file.

Files Changed:
- .github/workflows/.gitkeep (created - ensures empty directory is tracked by Git)

Key Decisions:
- Used .gitkeep file to maintain empty directory in Git (standard convention)
- Followed standard GitHub Actions directory structure (.github/workflows/)
