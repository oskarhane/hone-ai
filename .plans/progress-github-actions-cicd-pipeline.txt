TASK-004: Create manual minor release workflow
Date: 2026-01-29T15:45:12.789Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Created comprehensive minor version release workflow with manual dispatch trigger, version bumping, and git tag creation. Implemented proper minor version increment logic (e.g., 1.1.5 → 1.2.0) with safety measures and error handling.

Files Changed:
- .github/workflows/release-minor.yml (created - manual minor release workflow with confirmation safety)

Key Decisions:
- Used workflow_dispatch with "CONFIRM" input requirement for safety
- Implemented proper minor version increment logic preserving major, incrementing minor, resetting patch to 0
- Used Bun's JavaScript evaluation for reliable JSON manipulation of package.json
- Added comprehensive validation: git repository check, semantic version format validation
- Included git sync safety with remote pull/rebase before committing
- Added verification step to ensure version update succeeded
- Configured proper git credentials for automated commits and tagging
- Applied all learnings from task-003 review feedback (git sync, version validation, repository checks)

Workflow Features:
- Manual trigger only via workflow_dispatch (no automatic releases)
- Safety confirmation requirement ("CONFIRM" input)
- Current version detection from package.json
- Automated minor version calculation (major.minor+1.0)
- Package.json update and verification
- Git commit with descriptive message
- Git tag creation with version annotation
- Push to both tag and main branch
- Detailed success summary with version progression
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

Review Feedback Applied:
- All review feedback was positive ("LGTM") - no changes needed
- Implementation correctly meets all acceptance criteria
- Security, correctness, and code quality standards met
- Best practices applied from previous task learnings
