TASK-001: Create .github/workflows directory structure
Date: 2026-01-29T11:03:45.123Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Created GitHub Actions directory structure by initializing .github/workflows/ directory and ensuring Git tracking with .gitkeep file.

Files Changed:
- .github/workflows/.gitkeep (created - ensures empty directory is tracked by Git)

Key Decisions:
- Used .gitkeep file to maintain empty directory in Git (standard convention)
- Followed standard GitHub Actions directory structure (.github/workflows/)

TASK-002: Implement CI validation workflow
Date: 2026-01-29T11:07:22.456Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Created comprehensive CI validation workflow with test execution, type checking, and build validation. Applied review feedback to correct branch name from master to main.

Files Changed:
- .github/workflows/ci.yml (created - comprehensive CI workflow with all validation steps)
- .github/workflows/.gitkeep (deleted - no longer needed with actual workflow file)

Key Decisions:
- Used ubuntu-latest runner for compatibility and performance
- Implemented fail-fast behavior by default (workflow stops on first error)
- Used --frozen-lockfile for reproducible dependency installs
- Applied feedback to use correct branch name (main instead of master)
- Structured workflow with logical step ordering (cheapest operations first)

TASK-003: Create manual major release workflow
Date: 2026-01-29T11:20:15.789Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Created comprehensive major version release workflow with manual dispatch trigger, version bumping, and git tag creation. Includes safety confirmation prompt and proper error handling.

Files Changed:
- .github/workflows/release-major.yml (created - manual major release workflow)

Key Decisions:
- Used workflow_dispatch with confirmation input for safety ("CONFIRM" required)
- Implemented proper major version increment logic (e.g., 0.1.0 → 1.0.0)
- Used Bun's JavaScript evaluation for reliable JSON manipulation
- Added verification step to ensure version update succeeded
- Configured git credentials for automated commits and tagging
- Included comprehensive logging and success summary
- Used fetch-depth: 0 for full git history access
- Applied fail-fast behavior with proper exit codes

Workflow Features:
- Manual trigger only (no automatic releases)
- Safety confirmation requirement
- Current version detection from package.json
- Automated major version calculation
- Package.json update and verification
- Git commit with descriptive message
- Git tag creation with version annotation
- Push to both tag and main branch
- Detailed success summary with version info

TASK-003: Create manual major release workflow (FINALIZED)
Date: 2026-01-29T14:47:23.456Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Applied review feedback to enhance the major release workflow with additional safety measures and version validation.

Files Changed:
- .github/workflows/release-major.yml (modified - enhanced with git pull safety and version validation)

Key Decisions:
- Added git repository validation to ensure workflow runs in proper context
- Added semantic version format validation (x.y.z pattern) 
- Enhanced git sync safety with remote pull before committing
- Removed emoji characters for better cross-platform compatibility
- Maintained existing workflow structure and functionality

Review Feedback Applied:
- Git pull safety: Added remote sync check and rebase before committing
- Version validation: Added regex validation for semantic versioning format
- Repository validation: Added early git status check
- Enhanced error handling with clear failure messages

TASK-004: Create manual minor release workflow
Date: 2026-01-29T15:45:12.789Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Created comprehensive minor version release workflow with manual dispatch trigger, version bumping, and git tag creation. Implemented proper minor version increment logic (e.g., 1.1.5 → 1.2.0) with safety measures and error handling.

Files Changed:
- .github/workflows/release-minor.yml (created - manual minor release workflow with confirmation safety)

Key Decisions:
- Used workflow_dispatch with "CONFIRM" input requirement for safety
- Implemented proper minor version increment logic preserving major, incrementing minor, resetting patch to 0
- Used Bun's JavaScript evaluation for reliable JSON manipulation of package.json
- Added comprehensive validation: git repository check, semantic version format validation
- Included git sync safety with remote pull/rebase before committing
- Added verification step to ensure version update succeeded
- Configured proper git credentials for automated commits and tagging
- Applied all learnings from task-003 review feedback (git sync, version validation, repository checks)

Workflow Features:
- Manual trigger only via workflow_dispatch (no automatic releases)
- Safety confirmation requirement ("CONFIRM" input)
- Current version detection from package.json
- Automated minor version calculation (major.minor+1.0)
- Package.json update and verification
- Git commit with descriptive message
- Git tag creation with version annotation
- Push to both tag and main branch
- Detailed success summary with version progression
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

Review Feedback Applied:
- All review feedback was positive ("LGTM") - no changes needed
- Implementation correctly meets all acceptance criteria
- Security, correctness, and code quality standards met
- Best practices applied from previous task learnings
