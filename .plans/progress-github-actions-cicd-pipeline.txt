TASK-001: Create .github/workflows directory structure
Date: 2026-01-29T11:03:45.123Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Created GitHub Actions directory structure by initializing .github/workflows/ directory and ensuring Git tracking with .gitkeep file.

Files Changed:
- .github/workflows/.gitkeep (created - ensures empty directory is tracked by Git)

Key Decisions:
- Used .gitkeep file to maintain empty directory in Git (standard convention)
- Followed standard GitHub Actions directory structure (.github/workflows/)

TASK-002: Implement CI validation workflow
Date: 2026-01-29T11:07:22.456Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Created comprehensive CI validation workflow with test execution, type checking, and build validation. Applied review feedback to correct branch name from master to main.

Files Changed:
- .github/workflows/ci.yml (created - comprehensive CI workflow with all validation steps)
- .github/workflows/.gitkeep (deleted - no longer needed with actual workflow file)

Key Decisions:
- Used ubuntu-latest runner for compatibility and performance
- Implemented fail-fast behavior by default (workflow stops on first error)
- Used --frozen-lockfile for reproducible dependency installs
- Applied feedback to use correct branch name (main instead of master)
- Structured workflow with logical step ordering (cheapest operations first)
