TASK-001: rename do.ts files to reflect the name change from do -> run
Date: 2026-01-29T10:30:00Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Renamed do.ts and do.test.ts to run.ts and run.test.ts to reflect the command 
rename. Updated all imports and test descriptions.

Files Changed:
- src/do.ts → src/run.ts (renamed)
- src/do.test.ts → src/run.test.ts (renamed, updated test workspace path and descriptions)
- src/index.ts (updated import from './do' to './run')

Key Decisions:
- Pure rename refactor with no logic changes to minimize risk
- Updated test workspace path from .test-workspace-do to .test-workspace-run for consistency

Next Task: All tasks complete
