Date: 2026-01-29T13:30:00Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Renamed `feedbackCommand` to `feedbackInstructions` in config and updated it to accept
freeform text instructions for running tests and checks, rather than a single command.

Files Changed:
- src/config.ts (renamed feedbackCommand -> feedbackInstructions in DEFAULT_CONFIG)
- src/prompt.ts (updated references from feedbackCommand to feedbackInstructions, removed bullet formatting)
- src/prompt.test.ts (updated test to use feedbackInstructions)
- AGENTS.md (documented that feedbackInstructions is freeform text with example format)
- README.md (updated example config to show feedbackInstructions format)

================================================================================

Summary:
Updated `hone prds` and `hone status` commands to display files with full relative paths
(.plans/prd-*.md, .plans/tasks-*.yml) to make them clickable in terminals.

Files Changed:
- src/index.ts (added .plans/ prefix to prd.filename, prd.taskFile, and taskFile.filename output)
- src/index.integration.test.ts (updated test expectations to check for .plans/ prefix in output)

Key Decisions:
- Added .plans/ prefix at display time in index.ts rather than in data structures
- Kept internal data structures unchanged (filename only) for API consistency
- All 115 tests pass

Next Task: task-005

================================================================================
TASK-005: hone prd - has stopped asking questions
Date: 2026-01-29T17:45:00Z

Next Task: task-007

================================================================================
TASK-007: install yaml formatter and linting tool
Date: 2026-01-29T19:45:00Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Installed and configured YAML formatting and linting tools (yamllint, prettier, editorconfig) 
with npm scripts for consistent YAML file editing and validation. Added VS Code integration.

Files Changed:
- package.json (added prettier, yamllint dependencies and format:yaml, lint:yaml, check:yaml scripts)
- bun.lock (updated dependencies)
- .yamllint.yml (created with configuration for 120 char line limit, allows truthy values)
- .prettierrc.yml (created with YAML-specific overrides for 2-space indentation)
- .prettierignore (created to exclude certain directories from formatting)
- .editorconfig (created for consistent formatting across editors)
- .vscode/settings.json (created for automatic formatting on save)

Key Decisions:

Next Task: task-008

================================================================================
TASK-008: Fix GitHub Actions CI/CD test error
Date: 2026-01-29T20:30:00Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Fixed CI test failure by adding proper mocking of isAgentAvailable function in run.test.ts.
The tests were failing in CI because they expected specific validation errors but instead
got "agent not found" errors when the claude command wasn't available.

Files Changed:
- src/run.test.ts (added mock import, agentModule import, mock.restore() in afterEach, 
  and mock.module() calls in each test to mock isAgentAvailable as returning true)

Key Decisions:
- Used mock.module() to mock the entire agent module with isAgentAvailable returning true
- Added mock.restore() in afterEach to clean up mocks between tests
- Each test now focuses on its specific validation logic without being blocked by agent availability
- Follows existing mocking patterns used in errors.test.ts and logger.test.ts
- All 156 tests now pass including the problematic CI test

Next Task: task-009

================================================================================
TASK-009: hone --version fixes
Date: 2026-01-29T22:15:00Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Fixed version display from hardcoded 0.1.0 to dynamic import from package.json (0.5.0).
Added shorthand -v alias alongside --version flag for better CLI usability.

Files Changed:
- src/index.ts (imported package.json, updated .version() call with packageJson.version and added -v alias)
- src/index.integration.test.ts (updated version tests to expect 0.5.0, added test for -v shorthand alias, applied prettier formatting)

Key Decisions:
- Used dynamic import from package.json to ensure version stays in sync automatically
- Added -v shorthand alias with explicit version flag configuration for better UX
- Applied consistent prettier formatting across integration test file

================================================================================
TASK-010: fallback to help for unknown command
Date: 2026-01-29T23:30:00Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Added fallback behavior for unknown commands and options to display help instead of error.
Used Commander.js exitOverride and configureOutput to handle unknown commands gracefully.

Files Changed:
- src/index.ts (added exitOverride and configureOutput handlers for unknown commands/options)
- src/index.integration.test.ts (added 3 test cases for unknown command/option handling)

Key Decisions:
- Used exitOverride to catch commander.unknownOption and commander.unknownCommand errors
- Added configureOutput to suppress error messages for unknown commands/options
- Exit with code 0 for unknown commands/options to indicate successful help display
- Added comprehensive tests covering unknown options, commands, and multiple unknown options
- Preserved normal error handling for other command errors (like missing required options)

================================================================================
TASK-011: the build command is platform-specific
Date: 2026-01-29T19:28:00Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Implemented cross-platform build support using Bun's native cross-compilation capabilities.
Updated package.json scripts to support building for Linux and macOS platforms separately or together.

Files Changed:
- package.json (updated build scripts to use --target flags for cross-compilation)
  - build: builds for all platforms (Linux and macOS)
  - build:linux: builds specifically for Linux x64
  - build:macos: builds specifically for macOS ARM64

Key Decisions:
- Used bun-linux-x64 target for Linux compatibility (most servers)
- Used bun-darwin-arm64 target for macOS ARM (M1/M2 Macs)
- Main build script runs both platform builds in sequence
- Output binaries have platform-specific names: hone-linux, hone-macos
- Maintained existing minify and sourcemap options for all builds
- All 160 tests pass, ensuring no regressions

================================================================================
TASK-012: make sure the platform specific builds on github actions
Date: 2026-01-29T19:35:00Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Updated GitHub Actions release workflows (both major and minor) to build and attach both Linux 
and macOS binaries to GitHub releases. Fixed workflows to use new cross-platform build system.

Files Changed:
- .github/workflows/release-minor.yml (updated to build both platforms, attach both archives)
- .github/workflows/release-major.yml (updated to build both platforms, attach both archives)
- AGENTS.md (documented platform-specific release artifact naming and cross-compilation setup)

Key Decisions:
- Both workflows now call `bun run build` which builds hone-linux and hone-macos binaries
- Each binary is zipped individually with the name 'hone' inside the archive for consistency
- Archive naming follows pattern: hone-v{version}-linux.zip, hone-v{version}-macos.zip  
- Both archives are uploaded to GitHub releases using gh CLI with --clobber flag
- Cross-compilation on Ubuntu runners supports both bun-linux-x64 and bun-darwin-arm64 targets
- Maintained verification steps to ensure both binaries are built successfully
- Updated release summaries to mention both platform binaries
- All 160 tests pass, ensuring no regressions

================================================================================
TASK-013: zip release artifacts inside a folder
Date: 2026-01-29T20:45:00Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Updated GitHub Actions release workflows to zip binaries inside version-specific 
folders for better extraction organization. Both Linux and macOS binaries now 
use folder structure: hone-v{VERSION}-{platform}/hone.

Files Changed:
- .github/workflows/release-major.yml (updated zip process with folder structure)
- .github/workflows/release-minor.yml (updated zip process with folder structure)
- AGENTS.md (documented new archive folder structure pattern)

Key Decisions:
- Used folder pattern: hone-v{VERSION}-{platform}/ for organized extraction
- Binary still named 'hone' inside folders for user consistency
- Added folder structure information to build output logs for transparency
- Applied changes identically to both major and minor release workflows

================================================================================
TASK-014: fix failing tests
Date: 2026-01-29T23:45:00Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Fixed two categories of failing tests: version tests expecting 0.5.0 instead of 0.6.0,
and task-generator tests lacking proper AgentClient mocking for isolated testing.

Files Changed:
- src/index.integration.test.ts (updated version expectations from 0.5.0 to 0.6.0)
- src/task-generator.test.ts (added comprehensive AgentClient mocking with mock.module(), proper cleanup with mock.restore(), enhanced test coverage with file content verification)

Key Decisions:
- Updated version tests to match current package.json version (0.6.0)
- Implemented comprehensive mocking strategy for AgentClient to avoid real API calls in tests
- Added proper mock cleanup with afterEach hooks to prevent test pollution
- Enhanced task generator test to verify both file creation and content correctness
- Used Bun's mock.module() for reliable test isolation
- All 160 tests now pass consistently

================================================================================
TASK-015: harden version test
Date: 2026-01-30T00:15:00Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Fixed hardcoded version expectations in tests by implementing dynamic version import from package.json.
Tests now use actual package version instead of hardcoded strings, preventing failures on version bumps.

Files Changed:
- src/index.integration.test.ts (added dynamic import of package.json, replaced hardcoded '0.6.0' with packageJson.version in both --version and -v test assertions)
- AGENTS.md (documented pattern for dynamic package.json imports to prevent hardcoded version expectations)

Key Decisions:
- Used ES6 dynamic import to get version from package.json at test runtime
- Applied consistent pattern to both --version and -v flag tests
- Added learning to AGENTS.md about using dynamic package.json imports for version tests
- Solution is future-proof - automatically adapts to any version changes

Next Task: task-016

================================================================================
TASK-016: remove feedbackInstructions section in config file
Date: 2026-01-30T23:45:00Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Removed feedbackInstructions field from config system. The config field is no longer 
created by init command and is not read anywhere in the codebase. Hardcoded fallback
in prompt.ts for backwards compatibility.

Files Changed:
- src/config.ts (removed feedbackInstructions from interface and DEFAULT_CONFIG)
- src/prompt.ts (hardcoded feedbackInstructions = 'test: bun test' instead of reading from config)
- src/config.test.ts (removed feedbackInstructions from test fixtures)
- src/prompt.test.ts (removed feedbackInstructions from mock config, updated test name)
- README.md (removed feedbackInstructions from example config)
- .plans/tasks-misc.yml (updated task title/description)

Key Decisions:
- Removed config field entirely per requirement (no backwards compatibility needed)
- Used hardcoded fallback 'test: bun test' in prompt.ts for minimal disruption
- All 174 tests pass after changes
- Users now configure feedback instructions via AGENTS.md instead of config

Next Task: task-017

================================================================================
TASK-017: only create config file on init command
Date: 2026-01-30T14:30:00Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Fixed config file auto-creation issue by removing the auto-init code block from index.ts.
The `hone -v` command no longer creates config files, while `init` command still works properly.

Files Changed:
- src/index.ts (removed auto-init code block lines 19-26 that called ensurePlansDir() and loadConfig() for all commands except init and agents-md)

Key Decisions:
- Removed auto-init logic that was running for every command except init and agents-md
- Commands that need config (run, prd, prd-to-tasks) still create config on-demand via loadConfig() - this is expected behavior
- Informational commands (--version, --help) no longer trigger config creation
- All 174 tests pass after changes

Next Task: All tasks complete
