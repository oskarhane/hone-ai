TASK-001: rename do.ts files to reflect the name change from do -> run
Date: 2026-01-29T10:30:00Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Renamed do.ts and do.test.ts to run.ts and run.test.ts to reflect the command 
rename. Updated all imports and test descriptions.

Files Changed:
- src/do.ts → src/run.ts (renamed)
- src/do.test.ts → src/run.test.ts (renamed, updated test workspace path and descriptions)
- src/index.ts (updated import from './do' to './run')

Key Decisions:
- Pure rename refactor with no logic changes to minimize risk
- Updated test workspace path from .test-workspace-do to .test-workspace-run for consistency

Next Task: task-002

TASK-002: harden the task choosing step to make sure only tasks from the passed in tasks file are chosen
Date: 2026-01-29T11:45:00Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Added task file isolation guardrails to implement phase prompts. Added CRITICAL warning 
in task selection instructions explicitly forbidding selecting tasks from other files.

Files Changed:
- src/prompt.ts (added CRITICAL warning about task file isolation in IMPLEMENT_PHASE instructions)
- src/prompt.test.ts (added test validating warning text appears in prompt)
- AGENTS.md (documented task isolation pattern under "Prompt Construction" section)

Key Decisions:
- Used CRITICAL marker to emphasize the restriction in prompt instructions
- Added test coverage to prevent regression
- Documented pattern in AGENTS.md for future reference

Next Task: task-003
