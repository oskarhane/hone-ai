TASK-001: Update package.json with new name and binary configuration
Date: 2026-01-29T08:15:00.000Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Renamed package from xloop to hone-ai, configured binary mapping for 'hone' command, updated repository URLs and metadata. Applied review feedback to update .gitignore for new build output filenames.

Files Changed:
- package.json (modified: changed name to 'hone-ai', updated bin to 'hone', updated repo URLs, added keywords/description)
- .gitignore (modified: updated build output references from xloop/xloop.map to hone/hone.map)

Key Decisions:
- Package name: hone-ai (npm namespace available)
- Binary name: hone (simpler than hone-ai for CLI usage)
- Repository URL: https://github.com/oskarhane/hone.git (to be renamed in task-002)

Next Task: task-002

================================================================================

Files Changed:
- src/config.ts (modified: XLoopConfig → HoneConfig)
- src/errors.ts (modified: XLoopError → HoneError)
- src/commands/init.ts (modified: references to hone CLI and config)

================================================================================
TASK-003: Update CLI entry point and command structure
Date: 2026-01-29T15:45:00.000Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Updated CLI branding from xloop to hone throughout help text and command structure. Renamed 'do' command to 'run' command. All CLI help output now shows hone branding consistently.

Files Changed:
- src/index.ts (modified: program name to 'hone', 'do' command renamed to 'run', help text updated)
- src/commands/do.ts (modified: command description and help text to reference 'run' command)
- src/commands/prd-generate.ts (modified: help text to show hone commands)
- src/prompts/implement-phase.ts (modified: prompt instructions reference 'run' not 'do')
- src/prompts/review-phase.ts (modified: prompt context references 'run' not 'do')
- src/prompts/finalize-phase.ts (modified: prompt context references 'run' not 'do')
- test-prd-e2e.sh (modified: test script uses 'hone run' instead of 'xloop do')
- src/config.test.ts, src/errors.test.ts, src/task-utils.test.ts (modified: test descriptions reference hone)
- AGENTS.md (modified: updated CLI structure section to document hone commands)
- README.md (modified: usage examples show 'hone run' instead of 'xloop do')
- .plans/hone.config.json (created: initial config with hone branding)
- .gitignore (modified: added xloop binary to ignore list)

Key Decisions:
- Command renamed from 'do' to 'run' for better clarity (run <feature> is more intuitive)
- All help text consistently references 'hone' CLI name
- Config file properly created with hone branding during init
- Old xloop binary artifacts added to .gitignore for cleanup

Next Task: task-005

================================================================================
TASK-006: Update all string literals and user-facing messages
Date: 2026-01-29T16:30:00.000Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Verified that all user-facing string literals have been updated from xloop to hone. Fixed remaining xloop reference in old config file (.plans/xloop.config.json commitPrefix). All tests pass.

Files Changed:
- .plans/xloop.config.json (modified: commitPrefix from 'xloop' to 'hone')

Key Decisions:
- All source code already updated in task-004, no additional changes needed
- Error messages, log output, and user prompts all reference 'hone' consistently
- Old config file commitPrefix updated for consistency
- Remaining xloop references are only in PRD documentation and archived old-loop/ scripts

Next Task: task-007

================================================================================
TASK-006 FINALIZE: Apply review feedback and finalize
Date: 2026-01-29T17:00:00.000Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Applied review feedback from task-006. Deleted legacy .plans/xloop.config.json file that was no longer used by the codebase (config.ts:40 loads hone.config.json). Committed all tracking file changes.

Files Changed:
- .plans/xloop.config.json (deleted: legacy config no longer needed)
- .plans/tasks-package-rename-from-xloop-to-hone.yml (modified: marked task-006 as completed)
- .plans/progress-package-rename-from-xloop-to-hone.txt (modified: added finalize entry)

Key Decisions:
- Legacy xloop.config.json deleted to prevent user confusion
- No additional code changes needed - all work done in task-004
- Task-006 essentially verified completion of task-004 acceptance criteria

Next Task: task-007

================================================================================
TASK-008: Update build scripts and configuration files
Date: 2026-01-29T17:17:00.000Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Verified that build configuration already correctly references 'hone' from task-001. package.json:22 build script outputs to 'hone' binary. tsconfig.json has no package-specific references (generic Bun config). Successfully tested build process: produced 57M hone binary that runs correctly.

Files Changed:
- None (all build configuration already correct from task-001)

Key Decisions:
- Build script already outputs to 'hone' not 'xloop' (updated in task-001)
- No webpack/vite/rollup configs - using Bun's built-in bundler
- tsconfig.json is package-agnostic (no changes needed)
- Verified build produces working hone binary with correct version and help text

Next Task: task-009

================================================================================
TASK-009: Update test files and test configurations
Date: 2026-01-29T08:21:22.000Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Verified test files already updated from task-004. All test files use 'hone' branding, no test configs need updates, no mock/fixture files exist, and all 114 tests pass.

Files Changed:
- None (all test updates completed in task-004)

Key Decisions:
- Task-004 updated all test files (*.test.ts) with hone branding
- No xloop references found in any test files (grep verification)
- No separate test config files to update (using bun:test directly)
- No mock/fixture files found in codebase
- All 114 tests passing with new naming convention

Next Task: task-010

================================================================================
TASK-002: Rename repository and update all repository references
Date: 2026-01-29T08:22:48.000Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Verified repository rename task. No git remote configured and no CI/CD infrastructure exists. All repository URLs already updated in task-001 (package.json:10). Task acceptance criteria are N/A (no remote) or already complete.

Files Changed:
- None (all updates done in task-001)

Key Decisions:
- Repository has no git remote configured (verified with git config --get remote.origin.url)
- No .github folder or CI/CD configurations exist
- package.json already references correct repository URLs (updated in task-001)
- All applicable acceptance criteria complete: documentation links point to new repository (package.json:10-15)
- Remaining criteria N/A: no hosting platform, no CI/CD, no issue/PR templates

Next Task: task-007

================================================================================
TASK-007: Update documentation files and README
Date: 2026-01-29T18:45:00.000Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Addressed review feedback by adding npm global installation instructions to README. Verified all JSDoc comments already updated (no xloop refs in src/). Fixed incomplete docs from task-003 by adding primary installation method.

Files Changed:
- README.md (modified: added npm global installation section with 'npm install -g hone-ai')

Key Decisions:
- JSDoc comments: all xloop refs already removed in task-004 (verified via grep)
- API documentation: no separate API docs exist - all inline JSDoc
- Usage examples: already updated in task-003 ('do' → 'run' command)
- Primary installation method (npm global) was missing from README - now added
- Historical PRD files (.plans/prd-xloop.md) left unchanged - they're archival

Next Task: task-010
