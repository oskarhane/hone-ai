TASK-001: Remove commitPrefix from HoneConfig interface and DEFAULT_CONFIG
Date: 2026-01-29T10:55:12.000Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Successfully removed the commitPrefix property from the HoneConfig interface and DEFAULT_CONFIG object in src/config.ts. Additionally fixed all test files that referenced the removed property to ensure TypeScript compilation and tests pass.

Files Changed:
- src/config.ts (modified - removed commitPrefix property from interface and default config)
- src/config.test.ts (modified - removed all commitPrefix references from test configurations)
- src/prompt.test.ts (modified - removed commitPrefix from mock config object)

Key Decisions:
- Fixed test files as part of task-001 completion to meet acceptance criteria requiring successful TypeScript compilation
- Removed commitPrefix from all test configurations while preserving test logic
- Ensured backward compatibility by only removing unused configuration property

TASK-004: Update all test files to remove commitPrefix usage
Date: 2026-01-29T10:55:12.000Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Task-004 was completed as part of task-001 implementation. All commitPrefix references were successfully removed from test files to ensure TypeScript compilation and test execution succeeded after the interface changes.

Files Changed:
- src/config.test.ts (modified - removed commitPrefix from all test configurations)
- src/prompt.test.ts (modified - removed commitPrefix from mock config object)

Key Decisions:
- Test files were updated alongside interface changes to maintain compilation integrity
- All test logic preserved while removing commitPrefix references
- Task completed during task-001 but properly tracked as separate completion

Summary:

Files Changed:

Key Decisions:
- Kept example configuration clean and minimal, showing only active config options
