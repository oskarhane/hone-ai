TASK-008: Apply review feedback to planning docs
Date: 2026-02-17T10:24:16Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Applied review feedback to the planning docs by fixing YAML quoting, adding missing PRD trailing newline, and updating task dependencies. Added tracking entries and a YAML parsing learning to AGENTS.md. Ran bun test twice; one pre-existing failure in PRD generator integration test due to model format mismatch (expected provider-prefixed or legacy Claude).

Files Changed:
- .plans/tasks-detection-based-language-agnostic-agentsmd.yml (modified - fixed YAML quotes, updated task-006 dependencies, added task-008 completion)
- .plans/prd-detection-based-language-agnostic-agentsmd.md (modified - added trailing newline)
- .plans/progress-detection-based-language-agnostic-agentsmd.txt (created - task-008 finalization record)
- AGENTS.md (modified - added YAML straight-quotes guidance)

Key Decisions:
- Added task-008 to explicitly track finalize-phase review feedback
- Updated task-006 dependencies to include task-003 and task-004 for core generation changes
- Replaced curly-style quoting in YAML acceptance criteria with straight quotes

Next Task: task-001 - Audit current agents-md generation sections

TASK-001: Audit current agents-md generation sections
Date: 2026-02-17T10:28:39Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Audited current AGENTS.md generation sections and data sources. Documented baseline in a new audit file, mapping each section to agent/static sources and listing hardcoded defaults and fallbacks.

Files Changed:
- .plans/agentsmd-generation-audit.md (created - baseline audit of sections, sources, and hardcoded defaults)
- .plans/tasks-detection-based-language-agnostic-agentsmd.yml (modified - task-001 completion)
- .plans/progress-detection-based-language-agnostic-agentsmd.txt (updated - task-001 completion entry)

Key Decisions:
- Documented section order, source precedence (agent -> static fallback), and missing deployment fallback in baseline audit.
- Captured hardcoded defaults in both static analysis and feedback command generation for later replacement.

Next Task: task-002 - Define detection sources and tagging scheme

================================================================================
TASK-001: Audit current agents-md generation sections
Date: 2026-02-17T10:33:13Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Finalized review feedback tracking for task-001. Recorded the pre-existing integration test failure and added a config/regex alignment note to AGENTS.md.

Files Changed:
- .plans/tasks-detection-based-language-agnostic-agentsmd.yml (modified - updated task file timestamp)
- .plans/progress-detection-based-language-agnostic-agentsmd.txt (updated - finalize tracking entry)
- AGENTS.md (modified - noted config model format impact on regex tests)

Key Decisions:
- Documented that invalid model strings in `.plans/hone.config.yml` can trigger integration regex failures

Next Task: task-002 - Define detection sources and tagging scheme
