TASK-008: Apply review feedback to planning docs
Date: 2026-02-17T10:24:16Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Applied review feedback to the planning docs by fixing YAML quoting, adding missing PRD trailing newline, and updating task dependencies. Added tracking entries and a YAML parsing learning to AGENTS.md. Ran bun test twice; one pre-existing failure in PRD generator integration test due to model format mismatch (expected provider-prefixed or legacy Claude).

Files Changed:
- .plans/tasks-detection-based-language-agnostic-agentsmd.yml (modified - fixed YAML quotes, updated task-006 dependencies, added task-008 completion)
- .plans/prd-detection-based-language-agnostic-agentsmd.md (modified - added trailing newline)
- .plans/progress-detection-based-language-agnostic-agentsmd.txt (created - task-008 finalization record)
- AGENTS.md (modified - added YAML straight-quotes guidance)

Key Decisions:
- Added task-008 to explicitly track finalize-phase review feedback
- Updated task-006 dependencies to include task-003 and task-004 for core generation changes
- Replaced curly-style quoting in YAML acceptance criteria with straight quotes

Next Task: task-001 - Audit current agents-md generation sections

================================================================================
TASK-001 (finalize): Audit current agents-md generation sections
Date: 2026-02-17T10:28:39Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Audited current AGENTS.md generation sections and data sources. Documented baseline in a new audit file, mapping each section to agent/static sources and listing hardcoded defaults and fallbacks.

Files Changed:
- .plans/agentsmd-generation-audit.md (created - baseline audit of sections, sources, and hardcoded defaults)
- .plans/tasks-detection-based-language-agnostic-agentsmd.yml (modified - task-001 completion)
- .plans/progress-detection-based-language-agnostic-agentsmd.txt (updated - task-001 completion entry)

Key Decisions:
- Documented section order, source precedence (agent -> static fallback), and missing deployment fallback in baseline audit.
- Captured hardcoded defaults in both static analysis and feedback command generation for later replacement.

Next Task: task-002 - Define detection sources and tagging scheme

================================================================================
TASK-001: Audit current agents-md generation sections
Date: 2026-02-17T10:33:13Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Finalized review feedback tracking for task-001. Recorded the pre-existing integration test failure and added a config/regex alignment note to AGENTS.md.

Files Changed:
- .plans/tasks-detection-based-language-agnostic-agentsmd.yml (modified - updated task file timestamp)
- .plans/progress-detection-based-language-agnostic-agentsmd.txt (updated - finalize tracking entry)
- AGENTS.md (modified - noted config model format impact on regex tests)

Key Decisions:
- Documented that invalid model strings in `.plans/hone.config.yml` can trigger integration regex failures

Next Task: task-002 - Define detection sources and tagging scheme

================================================================================
TASK-002: Define detection sources and tagging scheme
Date: 2026-02-17T11:15:00Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Defined supported repo signal sources and a deterministic tagging scheme for multi-source aggregation. Clarified glob examples, aligned model config strings with validation, documented collect-not-override rules and stable ordering constraints, and ran bun test (pass).

Files Changed:
- .plans/agentsmd-detection-sources.md (modified - fix glob examples)
- .plans/hone.config.yml (modified - align model strings with validation)
- .plans/tasks-detection-based-language-agnostic-agentsmd.yml (modified - task-002 completion)
- .plans/progress-detection-based-language-agnostic-agentsmd.txt (updated - task-002 completion entry)
- AGENTS.md (modified - doc glob pattern guidance)

Key Decisions:
- Source tags use short category prefixes with relative paths or tool names for determinism.
- Aggregation is collect-not-override with dedupe only for exact normalized duplicates per source tag.
- Deterministic ordering: source type priority, then tag, then value.
- Model strings in `.plans/hone.config.yml` use provider-prefixed or legacy formats to satisfy validation.

Next Task: task-003 - Implement multi-source command detection

================================================================================
TASK-003: Implement multi-source command detection
Date: 2026-02-17T10:46:34Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Applied review feedback by distinguishing inferred command sources, preventing inline markdown extraction from double-counting code blocks, and exporting helper functions for unit testing. Expanded script categorization to tag build-prefixed scripts that run tests. Ran bun test (pass).

Files Changed:
- src/agents-md-generator.ts (modified - analysis source tags, markdown extraction fix, exported helpers, script categorization tweak)
- .plans/tasks-detection-based-language-agnostic-agentsmd.yml (modified - task-003 completion)
- .plans/progress-detection-based-language-agnostic-agentsmd.txt (updated - task-003 completion entry)
- AGENTS.md (modified - command detection learnings)

Key Decisions:
- Tag inferred commands with sourceType `analysis` to separate them from config file detections.
- Extract inline markdown commands only outside code blocks to avoid duplicates.
- Export command parsing helpers with `@internal` to enable focused unit tests.

- .plans/progress-detection-based-language-agnostic-agentsmd.txt (modified - task-005 entry)

Key Decisions:
- Exported `isUnavailableAgentResult` with `@internal` to enable focused unit testing
- Normalized "not available" checks with lowercasing to handle mixed-case agent output

Next Task: task-006 - Protect user content outside generated sections

================================================================================
TASK-006: Protect user content outside generated sections
Date: 2026-02-17T11:10:37Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Added unit coverage for AGENTS.md preservation helpers, fixed legacy preservation to skip nested generated headers by depth, and made generated block replacement non-greedy while retaining exact markers.

Files Changed:
- src/agents-md-generator.ts (modified - export preservation helpers, header-depth skipping, non-greedy block match)
- src/agents-md-generator.test.ts (modified - add preservation/merge tests)
- AGENTS.md (modified - note on generated block markers and nested header skipping)
- .plans/tasks-detection-based-language-agnostic-agentsmd.yml (modified - task-006 completion)
- .plans/progress-detection-based-language-agnostic-agentsmd.txt (modified - task-006 completion entry)

Key Decisions:
- Treat generated section headers as depth-scoped blocks so nested headers are skipped in legacy preservation.
- Keep generated block markers exact but use non-greedy replacement for safety.
