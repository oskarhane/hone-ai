TASK-001: Update package.json with new name and binary configuration
Date: 2026-01-29T08:15:00.000Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Renamed package from xloop to hone-ai, configured binary mapping for 'hone' command, updated repository URLs and metadata. Applied review feedback to update .gitignore for new build output filenames.

Files Changed:
- package.json (modified: changed name to 'hone-ai', updated bin to 'hone', updated repo URLs, added keywords/description)
- .gitignore (modified: updated build output references from xloop/xloop.map to hone/hone.map)

Key Decisions:
- Package name: hone-ai (npm namespace available)
- Binary name: hone (simpler than hone-ai for CLI usage)
- Repository URL: https://github.com/oskarhane/hone.git (to be renamed in task-002)

Next Task: task-002

TASK-003: Update CLI entry point and command structure
Date: 2026-01-29T15:45:00.000Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Updated CLI branding from xloop to hone throughout help text and command structure. Renamed 'do' command to 'run' command. All CLI help output now shows hone branding consistently.

Files Changed:
- src/index.ts (modified: program name to 'hone', 'do' command renamed to 'run', help text updated)
- src/commands/do.ts (modified: command description and help text to reference 'run' command)
- src/commands/prd-generate.ts (modified: help text to show hone commands)
- src/prompts/implement-phase.ts (modified: prompt instructions reference 'run' not 'do')
- src/prompts/review-phase.ts (modified: prompt context references 'run' not 'do')
- src/prompts/finalize-phase.ts (modified: prompt context references 'run' not 'do')
- test-prd-e2e.sh (modified: test script uses 'hone run' instead of 'xloop do')
- src/config.test.ts, src/errors.test.ts, src/task-utils.test.ts (modified: test descriptions reference hone)
- AGENTS.md (modified: updated CLI structure section to document hone commands)
- README.md (modified: usage examples show 'hone run' instead of 'xloop do')
- .plans/hone.config.json (created: initial config with hone branding)
- .gitignore (modified: added xloop binary to ignore list)

Key Decisions:
- Command renamed from 'do' to 'run' for better clarity (run <feature> is more intuitive)
- All help text consistently references 'hone' CLI name
- Config file properly created with hone branding during init
- Old xloop binary artifacts added to .gitignore for cleanup

================================================================================
TASK-006: Update all string literals and user-facing messages
Date: 2026-01-29T16:30:00.000Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Verified that all user-facing string literals have been updated from xloop to hone. Fixed remaining xloop reference in old config file (.plans/xloop.config.json commitPrefix). All tests pass.

Files Changed:
- .plans/xloop.config.json (modified: commitPrefix from 'xloop' to 'hone')

Key Decisions:
- All source code already updated in task-004, no additional changes needed
- Error messages, log output, and user prompts all reference 'hone' consistently
- Old config file commitPrefix updated for consistency
- Remaining xloop references are only in PRD documentation and archived old-loop/ scripts

Next Task: task-007

Date: 2026-01-29T17:00:00.000Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Applied review feedback from task-006. Deleted legacy .plans/xloop.config.json file that was no longer used by the codebase (config.ts:40 loads hone.config.json). Committed all tracking file changes.

Files Changed:
- .plans/xloop.config.json (deleted: legacy config no longer needed)
- .plans/tasks-package-rename-from-xloop-to-hone.yml (modified: marked task-006 as completed)
- .plans/progress-package-rename-from-xloop-to-hone.txt (modified: added finalize entry)

Key Decisions:
- Legacy xloop.config.json deleted to prevent user confusion
- No additional code changes needed - all work done in task-004
- Task-006 essentially verified completion of task-004 acceptance criteria
