TASK-001: Setup project with Bun and CLI framework
Date: 2026-01-28T13:30:00Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Initialized CLI structure using commander.js. Added all command stubs (prds, 
status, prd, prd-to-tasks, do) with proper flags. Installed dependencies:
commander, js-yaml, ai, @anthropic-ai/sdk. Package.json configured with bin 
entry for xloop command.

Files Changed:
- src/index.ts (created CLI with all command stubs)
- package.json (added dependencies, bin entry, version)
- bun.lock (updated with new dependencies)

Key Decisions:
- Using commander.js for CLI parsing (standard, well-maintained)
- All commands stubbed out with placeholder implementations
- Version set to 0.1.0
- Made index.ts executable with shebang

Next Task: task-002 (Implement .plans directory and config management)
