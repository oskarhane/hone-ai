Fixed critical regex pattern issues in content reference detection and implemented complete file/URL content fetching system with proper error handling and home directory expansion.

Files Changed:
- src/extend-prd.ts (modified - fixed detectContentReferences regex patterns, added proper home directory expansion in fetchFileContent, exported detectContentReferences function)

Key Decisions:
- Fixed regex patterns to properly capture file extensions and avoid spurious matches
- Implemented text-order preservation for consistent file path detection
