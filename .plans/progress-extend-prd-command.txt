TASK-002: Create PRD file parser and validator
Date: 2026-02-05T18:15:23.000Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Implemented comprehensive PRD parser and validator with section extraction, requirement ID parsing, validation logic, and helper functions. Added unit tests covering core functionality.

Files Changed:
- src/extend-prd.ts (modified - added parsePrdContent, extractRequirementIds, getNextRequirementId, validatePrdStructure functions with interfaces)
- src/extend-prd.test.ts (created - comprehensive unit tests for parser functions)

Key Decisions:
- Removed unused imports and constants (writeFile, path, EXPECTED_SECTIONS, unused patterns) based on review feedback
- Added comprehensive unit test coverage for all major parser functions
- Parser handles both functional (REQ-F-XXX) and non-functional (REQ-NF-XXX) requirements
- Validation includes required sections check and proper requirement subsection structure
- ID collision avoidance implemented for requirement numbering
