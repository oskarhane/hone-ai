TASK-001: Add extend-prd command structure to CLI
Date: 2026-02-05T17:57:47.000Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Implemented basic CLI command structure for 'hone extend-prd' using Commander.js with proper argument parsing, validation, and error handling following existing CLI patterns.

Files Changed:
- src/index.ts (modified - added extend-prd command with Commander.js configuration)
- src/extend-prd.ts (created - basic function structure with input validation and placeholder implementation)

Key Decisions:
- Used Commander.js pattern consistent with existing CLI commands
- Added comprehensive input validation with clear error messages
- Implemented placeholder function that will be extended in subsequent tasks
- Applied consistent import style following project conventions

TASK-002: Create PRD file parser and validator
Date: 2026-02-05T18:15:23.000Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Implemented comprehensive PRD parser and validator with section extraction, requirement ID parsing, validation logic, and helper functions. Added unit tests covering core functionality.

Files Changed:
- src/extend-prd.ts (modified - added parsePrdContent, extractRequirementIds, getNextRequirementId, validatePrdStructure functions with interfaces)
- src/extend-prd.test.ts (created - comprehensive unit tests for parser functions)

Key Decisions:
- Removed unused imports and constants (writeFile, path, EXPECTED_SECTIONS, unused patterns) based on review feedback
- Added comprehensive unit test coverage for all major parser functions
- Parser handles both functional (REQ-F-XXX) and non-functional (REQ-NF-XXX) requirements
- Validation includes required sections check and proper requirement subsection structure
- ID collision avoidance implemented for requirement numbering

TASK-003: Create task file parser and ID management
Date: 2026-02-05T22:15:00.000Z
================================================================================

Summary:
Implemented task file YAML parser with task ID extraction, collision-free ID generation, and comprehensive validation. Added comprehensive test suite covering all parser functions and edge cases.

Files Changed:
- src/extend-prd.ts (modified - added parseTaskFile, parseTaskFileContent, getNextTaskId functions with Task interface)
- src/extend-prd.test.ts (modified - added comprehensive unit tests for task parser functions)

Key Decisions:
- Used yaml package for robust YAML parsing with proper error handling
- Implemented sequential ID generation starting from highest existing task ID + 1
- Added comprehensive validation for required task fields (id, title, description, status)
- Pure parsing functions that don't mutate existing task data
- Extensive test coverage including error scenarios and edge cases
