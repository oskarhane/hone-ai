    title: "hone prd - has stopped asking questions"
    description: |
      the hone prd command has stopped asking clarifying questions.
      It should give instructions to the agent to investigate teh codebase then
      ask any clarifying questions that are needed to be able to write a concrete
      and non ambiguous prd.
      I think it might actually hang at the moment.
